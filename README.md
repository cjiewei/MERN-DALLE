# DALL-E Clone üñºÔ∏è

Build and deploy a Full Stack MERN AI Image Generation App

What I learn:

**Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js together**

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è

First, download the required packages and run the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables üõ†Ô∏è

The following are the environment variables required in your `.env` file

```js
MONGODB_URL =
OPENAI_API_KEY = 
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = 
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = 
```
MongoDB APIÔºö(https://cloud.mongodb.com/)

Cloudinary APIÔºö(https://cloudinary.com/)

OpenAI APIÔºö(https://openai.com/)

**NOTEÔºö** As of today, the code to get OpenAi may not work properly because the API is being billed.
